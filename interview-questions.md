# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `This` is the indicater to the computer that the function is calling on an object within itself. Without `this` prior to the key value that is being referenced the computer has no way to understand that you are calling on that specific value. 

  Researched answer: `This` is a method that refers to the object within a class. It allows the computer to understand that you are calling on a specific object within a class. Since classes are a means to group functions as a method, the Javascript language uses `this` as a way for the computer to understand that you are calling on something within the class. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a Javascript library that allows developers to easily organize and code several components in smaller sections for improved loading speed, performance and developer organization. The small sections of code are then combined in the App.js file to create useable and interactive projects. 

  Researched answer: React is an open source Javascript library used for building user interfaces. It creates an interactive and functional experience for users by collecting code snippets that are packaged and then pushed as a set. React helps developers maintain functionality with increased users and project scope by structuring code to be reusable by being made up of components using the principles of object-oriented programming.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The DOM is required to use React components. The DOM works in two sets, as the user experience DOM and the virtual DOM that tests to find changes within the program to update the real DOM.

  Researched answer: The render() method is required in a React class component. The render() method runs automatically when it is instantiated.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a version of Javascript that is used within React. It helps developers create better user interaction when building projects in React. JSX provides functionality and logic where as HTML is a static language that helps create the structure of a web page. When using JSX in React it is important to know that there are protected keywords within the language, so in .html files in React terms like "class" can not be used since this is a protected word in Javascript.

  Researched answer: JSX is an extension of Javascript that is primarily used in React. It helps developers create better user interaction when building projects in React. JSX provides functionality and logic where as HTML is a static language that helps create the structure of a web page. When using JSX in React it is important to know that there are protected keywords within the language, so in .html files in React terms like "class" can not be used since this is a protected word in Javascript. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a means to pull massive amounts of node modules into a project. Yarn tells the node modules how to behave in the code. In a React application, all javascript files are modified by yarn.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a javascript package manager. Yarn commands tell node modules how to behave in a project. 



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: A function that doesn't have a visual return that the user can see.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is an unnamed function.  


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: In React, conditional rendering is when certain elements of code are only rendered when specific conditions are met. Much like an if/else if statement in Javascript, conditional rendering returns different user experiences based on the user input. 

2. Props: Short for properties, 'props' is a keyword used to pass information from parent to child in a component. 

3. JavaScript Events: New Javascript Event instances are created when user changes are registered. The Event class has established methods to handle these changes to create a better experience for the user as they interact with an application. 

4. Object oriented programming: Is a programming methodology that is based on objects and classes to structure an application. The alternative to object oriented program is functional oriented programming. 

5. Ruby: Is a dynamic, scripting language that is an object-oriented programming language. Ruby is popular for building web applications.
